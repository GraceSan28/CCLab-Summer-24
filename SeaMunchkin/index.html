                <p> The SeaMunchkin's appearance transforms depending on its hunger level/mood. Usually a pale moody blob when hungry, a happy darker blob while eating, and only reveals its true form when its belly is satisfied; a true munch.</p>

                <span class="red">What we know so far about [ Sea Munchkin ]?</span> The Sea Munchkin is the only one of its kind discovered to date and has been given the scientific name Marinus Gluttophagus by its discoverer, Grace San, after she observed Munchkin's immaculate appetite. While not fully known how or where the Munchkin spawned from, it is believed that the creature is a variant of descendant of the Pokemon "Ditto" from the Pokemon Multiverse due to its ability to shapeshift. Its ability to express its emotions also has proven it to be a highly intelligent creature that can interact and co-exist with humans. Some have brought up the ideas of domesticating the Munchkin and keeping it as a pet; especially because it only seems to eat man-made food.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
            </p> Make sure to have enough food for the Munchkin or it'll make sure you know its not happy! Munchkin's whole life purpose is to munch, munch, and munch. Continue feeding the creature until it decides to show you its true form!
